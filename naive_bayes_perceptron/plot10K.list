BY: Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>

PL: Two married couples, sometimes including a returning champion, competed in
PL: one of the first game shows to offer $1 million as a grand prize. In
PL: "$1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime," which combined elements of "Wheel of
PL: Fortune" and "Scrabble," the couples competed to solve word puzzles. Up to
PL: six clues were given for the puzzle's solution; one member of each team was
PL: selected to try to guess each clue word, with letters inserted at random
PL: except for the last one. Each correct guess was worth $25 and allowed the
PL: contestant to go to the keyboard. The keyboard indicated which letters were
PL: in the puzzle, plus one "stinger" (an extra letter not in the puzzle);
PL: selecting the "stinger" meant the contestant lost his/her turn, and a new
PL: clue was played. Each selected letter revealed in the puzzle added $25 to
PL: the pot; the team that solves the puzzle won the pot. Three rounds were
PL: played, with the second round values of $50 per clue/puzzle letter and
PL: third round values of $100 each. The team with the most money after three
PL: rounds was champion, kept their winnings and advanced to the bonus round.
PL: In the bonus round, the couple selected a category from a choice of three
PL: and then are locked in an isolation booth. The couple has 60 seconds to
PL: guess six words associated with that category. For each successful bonus
PL: round win, the couple was given a cash prize ($5,000 on day 1, $10,000 on
PL: day 2), or they could give it back and continue, always at risk of losing a
PL: subsequent bonus round and thus having to leave the show. Only by winning
PL: three bonus rounds in a row did the couple win the $1 million grand prize.
PL: The $1 million was awarded as all cash during the spring 1986 season, and
PL: $900,000 plus a $100,000 luxury prize package (two Mazda cars, a house full
PL: of furniture, including a living room, dining room, bedroom, complete
PL: kitchen and outdoor spa, and twenty round-trip airline tickets to anywhere
PL: in America on Delta Air Lines) during the 1986-1987 season.

PL: needed ("I can name that tune in three notes!"). Contestants won points for
PL: winning each round; the high scorer after three rounds was champion and
PL: moved on to the "Golden Medley. In the "Golden Medley," the champion had to
PL: identify seven tunes within 30 seconds. Prizes were awarded for each
PL: correct answer. An incorrect guess stopped the game, while naming all seven

MV: "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982)

PL: René Artois runs a small café in France during World War II. He always
PL: seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his
PL: waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German
PL: soldiers who frequent his café, and he's running a major underground
PL: operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself
PL: is what nearly lands René and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped
PL: either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans,
PL: but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often
PL: create problems that René must solve quickly.

BY: Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

PL: René Artois is the owner and manager of a café in German-occupied France of
PL: World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him
PL: irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith.
PL: René's café, frequented by both the German military and the French
PL: resistance, is the focal point for the show. René's a bit of a coward and
PL: is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the café are
PL: two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters
PL: include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil
PL: SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his
PL: small sidekick. René's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering
PL: and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with
PL: Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for
PL: servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British
PL: agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of "Zee Fronch
PL: Linguige," and from René's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.

BY: Rob Hartill

PL: In this spoof of World War II, René Artois runs a café in German-occupied
PL: France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the
PL: command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the
PL: command of Michelle Dubois ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only
PL: once"). René is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the
PL: world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots
PL: include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General
PL: Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called "The
PL: Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"--a painting that everybody would love
PL: to get their hands on to sell after the war. He has also two downed idiot
PL: British airmen who, as time goes by, are impossible to get rid of. The main
PL: opposition is the insane SS officer Otto Flick. René tries to complete the
PL: German and the Fench Resistance's plans, even though he's a coward and
PL: wonders if he's going to get out of the war alive.

PL: causes his bomber to crack up on takeoff, killing or injuring several

PL: When Gen. Savage's plane is shot down by a German Trojan horse (a captured

PL: over temporary command of the 918th. As a reluctant candidate for permanent

PL: Every series deserves at least one good spooky episode, and this is it for
PL: 12o'H. The Lorelei is a bomber that returns from a mission and lands
PL: intact, but with its entire crew dead. Gen. Savage assigns the plane to his
PL: new 2nd-in-command, Col. Royce, who he's supposed to evaluate for
PL: assignment as a group commander. Royce is a highly-experienced, decorated,
PL: and well-liked pilot with one apparent flaw; he's decidedly superstitious,

PL: General Savage decides to court martial a pilot, Captain Ritchie, who
PL: disobeyed a direct order and left the bomber formation to protect a friend,
PL: Lt. Lockridge, and his crew who have bailed out of their crippled B-17.
PL: Because everyone else considers Ritchie a hero, Savage's severe action
PL: instigates a fall in morale and hostile feelings among his men. Savage must
PL: convince his troops that while Ritchie's deed may have saved the lives of
PL: the 7 men, it also jeopardized the security of the remaining 200 men in the
PL: Group. This is especially difficult for Lockridge, who must weigh his
PL: gratitude to his friend against the inescapable reality of Savage's
PL: argument.

BY: alexk-6

PL: The action appears entirely justifiable; Captain Wade Ritchie leaves the
PL: returning bomber formation, which is under fire over the English Channel,
PL: to fight off enemy planes heading for the parachuting crew of Lt. Tom
PL: Lockridge's destroyed bomber. But Savage, who'd given orders that no one
PL: was to leave formation, demands a court martial for Wade, a medal for Lt.
PL: Lockridge. Wade's defense is he and Lockridge are friends, would do the
PL: same for him. Savage doesn't think young Lt. Lockridge, who plans to marry
PL: a pretty nurse, Lt. Libby MacAndrews, and make the Air Force his career,
PL: would disobey orders for anyone. Savage is shunned by everyone for his
PL: insistence on going by the book and is in danger of having to answer
PL: embarrassing questions when Lockridge decides to turn down his medal. But
PL: Wade's gunner, wounded in the disputed action, dies in hospital and
PL: everyone suddenly sees Wade had no right to risk his crew to save
PL: Lockridge. Savage is proved right all around when Wade panics in the next
PL: action while flying co-pilot with Savage who is wounded, Wade calls over
PL: the radio to Lockridge to come to his rescue. Lockridge coolly refuses and
PL: Savage, despite his serious shoulder wound, is left to take the plane he

PL: Great Britain, 1990. The population is now governed by an increasingly
PL: corrupt bureaucracy headed by the Home Secretary and backed by the
PL: tyrannical Public Control Department (PCD), who have done away with the
PL: rights of the individual and maintain control through ID cards, rationing,
PL: censorship and electronic/audio/physical surveillance. Free speech is
PL: forbidden. The rule of law no longer protects the weak and defenseless.
PL: Emigration is impossible. But escape is not, thanks to rebels like Jim Kyle
PL: ('Edward Woodward' (qv)), a journalist and secret dissident who battles the
PL: forces of the Establishment, but constantly faces imprisonment or death (or
PL: worse) at the hands of the PCD and its ruthless controller Herbert Skardon.

PL: Affairs correspondent Jim Kyle, a journalist for one of Britain's three
PL: remaining newspapers, provides secret assistance to people trying to escape
PL: the repressive regime. His activities continually bring him into contact
PL: with the Public Control Department, its tools of bureaucratic repression
PL: and its ruthless Controller Herbert Skardon. However, Kyle's current

PL: Wainwright to the United States of America to promote their cause, the plan
PL: backfires disastrously when his speech is littered with dissident
PL: criticisms of the bureaucratic nightmare the United Kingdom has become

PL: compliment by sending him to an Adult Rehabilitation Centre, a place where
PL: offenders against the state (political activists, murderers, thieves, etc)

PL: After the Kyle Trial fiasco, Skardon takes his revenge by turning Kyle into
PL: a Non-Citizen: stripping Kyle of his ID and Union cards, freezing his bank
PL: account and seizing all his assets. With no home, no car, no job, no money,
PL: only the clothes on his back and his family missing (and a bugged
PL: Non-Citizen ID card so the PCD can track him), Kyle is forced to wander the
PL: streets in what seems like a hopeless attempt to survive, especially when
PL: he is constantly and sadistically harassed by Skardon and Inspector
PL: Nichols. His only hope is that Dave Brett and black marketeer Sammy Calhoun
PL: can find him before his mind and will are permanently broken.

PL: "Authorised Systematic Harassment has enormous potential. The slow and

PL: remarks printed in the underground press from Kyle and Tony Doran, devise a
PL: plan to turn the heat up on the pair by employing a systematic campaign of

PL: the Public Control Department has been successful, but the public suicide
PL: of a cell member has resulted in world condemnation of Britain's policies

PL: despite the legitimacy of the claim. However, one judge, Philip Carter, is
PL: determined to fight the corrupt legal system and continually votes to

PL: and a weak-willed third judge. Angered by Carter's defiance, the Attorney
PL: General demands that Skardon and the PCD find a way to silence Carter. The
